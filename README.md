# Tweets

A script to get all the tweets from the [@yourfirstpr](https://twitter.com/yourfirstpr) twitter account

> "But, that's easy! You can do it by doing blahblahbeepboopbleep "

This is an opportunity for me ([@charlotteis](https://twitter.com/charlotteis)) to learn to work with Node.js better, 
as well as use the Twitter API which I haven't done before.


Initial Criteria:
* [x] Running `node tweets.js` will fetch all tweets from the [@yourfirstpr](https://twitter.com/yourfirstpr) Twitter account

Next Steps:
* [x] Be able to specify how many tweets you receive back
* [x] Make sure they are standalone tweets, not replies to anything
* [x] Get all the links out of the standalone tweets
* [ ] Open an `.HTML` page with all the links from those tweets listed

In the end, I'd like to be able to run a simple script that gets the last X tweets,
extracts the links from those tweets, writes them to an .HTML page where I can open them all
or just open all of them in the browser from the command line. This is so I can
check to see whether Issues I've posted have had successful PR's. If they haven't, 
it means I can schedule to tweet about them again in the near future.
